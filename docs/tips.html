Some of these include:</p><div style="height: 22px;"></div><ul><li>Private accounts - most social media services offer an option for a private account. A private account makes it so you control who can see the content that you post. This allows you to only let the people follow you that you trust so they don’t use anything you post against you.  </li><li><div style="height: 22px;"></div>Another suggestion is two-factor authentication. Some social media sites have an option where you can add a password, as well as send a code to your phone number or email address. In case of an online attempt to hack into your account, two factor authentication ensures that the person cannot get into your account unless they have access to your inbox and/or phone number.  </li><li><div style="height: 22px;"></div>Whether you use two factor authentication or not, it is important to use strong passwords. The stronger the password, the harder it is to crack. This means that it is less likely that your account will be hacked, however, it does not guarantee that.&nbsp;<div style="height: 22px;"></div> </li></ul></div><div class="block-heading"><h2 class="text-info">Password Tips</h2><ul><li>Use complex passwords i.e symbols, capitals, numbers, two-words, etc </li><li>Use different passwords for different things</li><li>Use a password manager to generate passwords to only have to remember one secure password, some are linked on the tools page</li><li>Use the howsecureismypassword tool linked on the tools page when creating a password to see how long it would take to crack</li></ul></div><div class="block-heading"><h2 class="text-info">Characteristics of Suspicious Emails</h2><ul><li>Poor spelling and grammar - if the person sending you an email has poor spelling and or grammatical errors, they may be impersonating others, etc  </li><li><div style="height: 22px;"></div>Suspicious URL’s - before clicking a link in an email, hover over it with your mouse to make sure that the URL seems safe and legit. Remember to never click a link until you know that it is safe and that it comes from someone you trust.</li><li><div style="height: 22px;"></div>Suspicious attachments - if a file or something else is attached to an email, it is best not to open it. Unless you trust the sender, opening unknown attachments can cause a wide variety of problems including (but not limited to) viruses and many more.<div style="height: 22px;"></div> </li><li>What are they asking? - if the sender is asking for personal information, then they’re probably not legit. You can mark their email as spam and delete it, never give out personal information to those you don’t know and/or to those you don’t trust <div style="height: 22px;"></div></li><li>If the sender is making unrealistic promises or threats, it’s most likely fraudulent. Some examples of this include, “send us money in exchange for gift cards”, “urgent action is required”, etc. Scammers online send emails with things like this in order to try to get something out of the receiver or scare them into doing something. Remember to never follow through with the actions asked by someone who you do not trust.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div class="block-heading"><h2 class="text-info">Maintaining Safe Social Media Posts</h2><p>Make sure your social media posts don't have the following</p><ul><li>Addresses  </li><li>Phone Numbers</li><li>Profane language - it is best to stay away from using profane language online, future or current employers can likely easily look you up and see this stuff<div style="height: 22px;"></div> </li><li>Just to repeat what was said before, make sure that what you post on social media is something you’re okay with being up forever. Digital footprints track things said online, things you like, comments you make, etc. A digital footprint can be used by future employers and in some cases it can be very difficult to get a job when you post sensitive and inappropriate content online.&nbsp;<div style="height: 22px;"></div></li></ul></div></div></section></main><script src="assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/baguettebox.js/1.10.0/baguetteBox.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
